This script uses the requests library to connect to the OpenNotify API and retrieve the current location of the International Space Station (ISS). It then uses the json library to parse the response and extract the latitude and longitude coordinates. The geopy library's Nominatim class is used to convert the coordinates to a physical address.

The script also uses the tkinter library to create a simple graphical user interface (GUI) that displays the location of the ISS in terms of its latitude, longitude, and address. The GUI also has a "Refresh" button that allows the user to update the location information.

To use this script, you will need to have the requests, json, geopy, and tkinter libraries installed.
